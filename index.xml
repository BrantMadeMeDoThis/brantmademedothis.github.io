      <description>He Said They Said is the brainchild collaborative group of Happy Valley Improvâ€™s James Tierney and Dawn Rosenbaum. This two-person longform group focuses on creating worlds with big characters that end up colliding in hilarious ways. It all begins with a rumor given by a member of the audience, and it quickly spirals out of control to inspire the amazing world the players create. The characterâ€™s themselves can and will be played by either person during the course of the show.</description>
