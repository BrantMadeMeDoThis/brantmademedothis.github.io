            <article>
              <p>Whether You are New to the concept of that T in the GLBTQIA or not, I have a few books that I have kept throughout the years as I think they resonate with many different people and lead to better understanding and inclusion of all genders. Here are my top picks:</p>
<p><strong>To Get Educated:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transgender 101: a Simple Guide to a Complex Issue</strong> Nicholas M Teich</p>
<p>If you have no idea what transgender means or think you might have some questions that could be embarrassing to ask this is the book for you. It covers topics such as “what does it mean to be transgender”,  gender vs sexual orientation, the coming out process, the transition process, to barriers that transpeople still face today, etc. It is a good introductory book that can answer a lot of questions you may have.</p>
<p><strong>Transgender History: The Roots of Today’s Revolution</strong> Susan Stryker</p>
<p>Did you know that some people think that transgenderism is a fad and has only been around recently? Enter this beautiful collection of over a hundred years worth of history featuring transpeople and society’s response to them. It’s honest. It’s brutal. It is what I like to throw at people who try to tell me that because Transgenderism hasn’t been on their radar it must not be something that has been around for a while. Prepare to be enlightened, possibly angered, but hopefully empowered to support a group of people that have been resilient against so much oppression and hatred.</p>
<p><strong>Second Son</strong> Ryan K Sallans</p>
<p>This is the story of Ryan Kim Sallans discovery and transition from Female to Male. He has taught me so much about how to be more aware, compassionate, and authentic to my true self in my everyday life and his story is honest and really helps to empathize with the many things he had to go through.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Normal Anyway?</strong> Morgan Boecher</p>
<p>This is a graphic novel about a person’s transition from female to male. It is hilarious, moving, and quirky and shows a unique perspective of what to expect when you go through puberty&hellip;again.</p>
<p><strong>For ALL Parents:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gender Quest Workbook: a Guide for Teens and Young Adults Exploring Gender Identity</strong> Testa et al.</p>
<p>I have given many talks about being a safe and compassionate ally to the GLBT community. When we talk about gender, I will say “raise your hand if you have a gender identity” and when we talk about sex I say “raise your hand if you have a sexual orientation”. To this day, I have yet to have everyone (or even half) of the group raise their hand. Here is a fact:</p>
<p>EVERYBODY has a sexual orientation and EVERYBODY has a gender identity. This book is such a great book that starts by helping people describe and discover their gender identity, think about how they currently express it, and how it impacts their relationships, well-being and dreams for the future. I recommend it to all parents as discovering these things and talking about it with your child can be really beneficial for both of you, especially during a time of adolescence when we are asking many of these questions of ourselves but might not have the correct words for it.</p>
<p><strong>For ALL People:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness and Acceptance for Gender and Sexual Minorities</strong> Mathew Skinta</p>
<p>If you want to make sure you are fostering compassion, connection and equality in your every day life and workplace for gender and sexual minorities, this is the book for you. Written by a clinician, it helps many people to be inclusive and break down previous behaviors that could lead to negative outcomes for these minority groups. This helps you be a true supportive entity for conversations about gender, coming out, etc.</p>
